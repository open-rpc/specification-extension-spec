# OpenRPC Specification Extension

### Goals

- **Define an extension in JSON** - Human and machine readable.
- **Consistent with OpenRPC** - familiar OpenRPC terms.
- **Extend OpenRPC** - so developers can add features and tooling around OpenRPC that isn't currently in the spec, or falls outside of the specification context.
- **Prototype New OpenRPC changes** - new additions to the OpenRPC specification can be created and prototyped as a Specification Extension and have working tooling before being merged into the OpenRPC specification.

You can view the JSON-RPC meta-schema here: [./meta-schema.json](./meta-schema.json).
